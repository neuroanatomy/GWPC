This repository contains the code used for the analyses described in our manuscript "Increased contrast of the grey-white matter boundary in the motor, visual and auditory areas in Autism Spectrum Disorders" (Preprint: https://doi.org10.1101/750117).

We used this code to analyse the grey-white contrast in Autism Spectrum Disorder using magnetic resonance imaging from ABIDE 1&2 datasets (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/).
